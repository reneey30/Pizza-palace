Pizza Palace Author IRENE NJERU

Description
Pizza palace being a new joint in town, building a website came in handy since it has a lot of advantages e.g :
i) Enhance Home delivery
ii) You just dial and the Pizza joint takes your order
iii) You just get charged for same delivery fee even when you order 10 pizzas
The website idea is more ideal as it user friendly and direct to the point
